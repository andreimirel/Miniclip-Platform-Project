# Miniclip-Platform-Project

This project is developed in Visual Studio and consists of a suite of four simple games implemented in C++. The included games are Tetris, Pacman, Rapid Fire, and Tanks, each providing a fun and engaging experience.

1. Tetris
Tetris is a classic puzzle game where the player must arrange falling geometric pieces (tetrominoes) within a playing area. The goal is to complete horizontal lines to clear them and earn points. The more lines you clear at once, the higher your score. The game progressively speeds up, increasing the difficulty.

2. Pacman
Pacman is an action game where the player controls a round character called Pacman. The goal is to navigate through a maze, eat points, and avoid ghosts chasing you. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score without getting caught.

3. Rapid Fire
Rapid Fire is a fast-paced shooting game. The player must eliminate rapidly moving targets on the screen. The score increases based on accuracy and speed in hitting targets. The game tests the player's reflexes and shooting skills.

4. Tanks
Tanks is a strategy game where players control tanks and engage in tactical battles. The objective is to destroy the opponent using smart maneuvers and precise shots. Each tank has unique abilities, and the battlefield includes obstacles and cover spots. Players must think strategically to secure victory.
